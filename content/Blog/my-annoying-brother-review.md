After lot of work, I decided to watch My Annoying Brother, just because of it's cast without knowing the story, that was the best decision I had made. 

The movie starts off with Judo match and prison scene were two brothers at current point of time. The younger one losses his eyesight during the match and the older one gives the excuse of him to live outside the prison.

As the story progress, you would notice that the older one doesn't care of his younger sibling, but after some time they come closer, showing kindness towards each other, everything is going fine but than comes the moment which takes us, the viewers to the extreme end of life DEATH.

The older brother finds out that he has only few months left and he wants his brother to win gold medal at Paralympics. He pursued him to go forward without telling him that he wouldn't be there to celebrate his success.

The movie teaches us that our family is important to us, no matter if person doesn't care but when the time comes we all remember the memories we have made with them.
